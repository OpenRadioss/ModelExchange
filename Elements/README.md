# Introduction

In this section, the individual element types will be introduced and a basic application will be demonstrated with an example.

There are different types of elements:
* 0-D Elements: e.g: mass-elements (/ADMAS) or smooth particle hydrodynamics (/SPHCEL),...
* 1-D Elements: e.g: springs, trusses, beams, rigids,...
* 2-D Elements: e.g: shells,...
* 3-D Elements: e.g: tetra4- or hexa-elements
* others/exotic: e.g: Multi-strand element (/XELEM),...

For further details, please review the manual pages.

Within this repository, a collection of useful applications is created with the warm request to everyone to enhance it by small, useful examples, which can be useful for everyone.
